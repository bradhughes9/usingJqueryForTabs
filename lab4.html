			<h1>Javascript</h1>
			<p>
				JavaSctipt is a programming language that brings life to your webpage in many different ways. Java script can alter the style your page,change the 
				content in your page, and also show/hide content in your webpage. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS all three go hand in hand when building a webpage. HTML is
				the is the foundation of the webpage, CSS customizes that foundation, and JavaScript makes the webpage more dynamic by allowing the content to be programmable. 
				Using JavaScript is just like using Java, except your web browser has a built in enterpreter. You can do things with JavaScript like make your page refresh
				on it's own, autofill text boxes, and much more. Adding JavaScript to your website is as simple as adding CSS, all you have to do is link the ".js" with all
				all of your javascript to your html document. For the gaming aspect of JavaScript, it can be used to develop mobile apps and also games that are directly played
				on your web browser. All of this coding is done by writing what are known as Scripts in the JavaScript language. From the sounds of it JavaScript is mainly used
				for the front end development of webpages, but it is also used in the back end of development. To learn more about JavaScript review the links below.

			<h1>PHP</h1>
			<p>
				PHP is a server side scripting language that can be used for anything web development related. While PHP is a easy to pick up language for beginners
				it can also be used by more advanced/professional users as well. PHP is scripts that are coded into your HTML file or in it's own file on a text editor,
				but are executed on the server side. If you plan to use PHP make sure you have a FTP client so that you can transfer your files from your computer to your
				website. PHP is similar to most software languages in regards to using variables, booleans, arrays, etc. So having a basic understanding of HTML and maybe
				even other coding languages can give you an advantage with using PHP. For more information on PHP visit the links below.

			<h1>AJAX</h1>
			<p>
				AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. AJAX is used to perform tasks in the background by accessing webservers from webpages so that
				tasks can be performed without even having to refresh th page. AJAX is not a programming language but is a method of building websites and web applications.
				A good example of AJAX being used is whenever you type in a search bar, login box, or anything of the sort and the box begins to autofill the more you 
				type, that box is refreshing and bringing you new content without refreshing the entire page. There are also functions AJAX can do that require the page
				to reload, say you are on any forum that contains multiple pages and you want to goto the next page, when you click the "Next Page" button and a bunch of
				new data shows up, that is AJAX working with JSON or XML. Having an understanding of AJAX can widen your ability of desinging and creating websites.
				View the links below for more information on AJAX.

			<h1>Jquery</h1>
			<p>
				Jquery is a framework that makes the use of Javascript much easier for you to use. It is the most popular framework out there today. Lots of major companies
				and also smaller companies are all using Jquery becasue of howmuch simplier and cleaner it is to code. Jquery saves web developers a lot of time and energy 
				by allowing them to write what used to be a lot of code into just a few short lines of code. Jquery has a large number of plugins that you can use on your webpage
				that range from what they can do from effecting scrolling, to auto completion and much more. Jquery is mainly used to maipulate most aspects of your webpage.
				Now that you've heard all of the great stuff you may be wonderiing how you can use Jquery yourself, well there are a couple of ways. The first way would be to 
				use this Content Delivery Network from google: src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js". Another alternative would be to go to 
				<a href="https://jquery.com/" rel="external" title="jquery download">Here</a></li> and download it to use as a seperate file. Below are links for more information
				on Jquery!
